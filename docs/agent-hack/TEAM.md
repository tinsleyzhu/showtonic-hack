# TEAM — coordination document

**Every agent reads this at the start of every loop iteration and writes to it
before going idle.** It is the only shared state. If it is not written here, it
did not happen.

Hard deadline: **submissions lock Thursday 2026-08-27 15:00 PDT.** Doors close
20:00 both nights; there is no overnight.

Shape is **writer lanes + merge authority**, because the dominant risk here is
not missed findings — it is *chained dependencies stalling everything* and
*write races on one repo*. Four lanes, each fenced in its own worktree, each
shipping independently; one node holds merge, deploy, and the human.

## Nodes

| Node | Worktree / branch | Model | Lane — and what it does NOT do |
|---|---|---|---|
| **coordinator** | `showtonic-hack` / `main` | Opus 5 | Merges, deploys (Convex + Wrangler), owns the IC submission and the human. Does not write feature code while lanes are live. |
| **L1 enrich** | `st-enrich` / `lane/enrich` | Haiku 4.5 | Artist/venue data enrichment through rate-limited third-party APIs. High call volume, mechanical. Does not touch the matcher or the UI. |
| **L2 match** | `st-match` / `lane/match` | Opus 5 | Backfill accuracy: vision evidence, catalog-gap agent, eval harness. The hardest reasoning and the only lane with a numeric target. Does not touch enrichment sources. |
| **L3 taste + p2p** | `st-taste` / `lane/taste` | Sonnet 5 | Taste-profile v2 and peer-to-peer discovery between agents. Does not touch backfill scoring. |
| **L4 sponsors + demo** | `st-sponsors` / `lane/sponsors` | Sonnet 5 | Sponsor integrations (Runtype, Hacker Bob, Tenki, Nebius) early; demo rehearsal and failure drill late. Does not touch product logic. |

Model routing rationale: Haiku on the lane that is mostly I/O against
rate-limited APIs; Opus on the lane with an adversarial eval and the hardest
scoring logic; Sonnet where the work is design-shaped and broad.

## Trust boundary

Each lane is confined by **its own git worktree** — not by asking nicely. A lane
physically cannot edit another lane's files. Only the coordinator merges to
`main`, only the coordinator runs `npx convex dev --once` or `wrangler deploy`,
and only the coordinator speaks to the human or to Immersive Commons.

That last fence is not bureaucracy. **The Convex dev deployment is shared
mutable state**: if two lanes push functions at once they clobber each other,
and the live demo is the casualty. Lanes prove their work with `npm test` and
pure-module evals, then hand it to the coordinator to deploy.

## Ground rules

1. **Smallest deployable item.** Ship one feature end-to-end, then the next.
   Never build two things that must land together.
2. **Atomic commits.** One logical change per commit, tests passing at each.
3. **Deep research first.** Before writing code in a new area, read the actual
   API docs / existing code. Cite what you read in your status block.
4. **Blocked? Switch.** If you are waiting on the human or another lane, pick up
   the next unblocked item in your own lane. Never idle-wait.
5. **Never break the demo.** `main` must stay deployable at every moment.
6. **Stay alive.** Finishing your task list does not mean exiting. Re-read this
   file, look for unclaimed work in your lane, or improve test coverage.
7. **HITL is the coordinator only.** If you need a human decision, write it under
   NEEDS-HUMAN below and message the coordinator. Do not wait for a reply.

## Handing work to the coordinator

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "…"        # atomic, tests green
git push -u origin lane/<name>
gh pr create --fill --base main        # then message the coordinator
```

## STATUS — append, do not rewrite others' blocks

Format. Keep it to five lines; the point is scannability, not prose.

```
### <lane> · <ISO timestamp>
state:    building | blocked | shipped | idle
now:      one line — what you are doing this iteration
shipped:  PR # or commit sha, or "-"
blocked:  what on, or "-"
next:     the next smallest deployable item
```

### coordinator · 2026-08-26T23:30Z
state:    building
now:      standing up the team; worktrees created, main pushed clean
shipped:  c2aa32f (all lanes branched from here)
blocked:  -
next:     refresh the IC submission; merge lane PRs as they arrive

---

## NEEDS-HUMAN — coordinator relays these; do not block on them

- [ ] AIsa credits: confirmed working on the second key. No action.
- [ ] Cotal `cli` actor grant — an operator must run
      `cotal actor grant cli --sub n6TFVkKoOfXvdKqfF87MVP3xXuo9rhl6`.
      Only needed if we want mesh-witnessed transcripts. Not blocking.
- [ ] Door check-in at the badge table — no tool can do it.
- [ ] Spotify developer app (client id + secret) — would make L1 ~9x faster.

## CLAIMED — take a line before you start, so two lanes never collide

| Item | Lane | Since |
|---|---|---|
| artist genre enrichment | L1 | 23:30Z |
| catalog-gap agent (Tavily) | L2 | 23:30Z |
| taste profile v2 | L3 | 23:30Z |
| Runtype spike | L4 | 23:30Z |
